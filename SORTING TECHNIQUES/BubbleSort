Bubble sort is another simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Hereâ€™s how it typically works:

My Approach:
Comparison and Swap: It compares each pair of adjacent items in the list and swaps them if they are in the wrong order (ascending or descending).
Passes through the List: Each pass through the list places the next largest (or smallest) unsorted element in its correct position.
Repeat Until Sorted: It repeats this process until the list is sorted.

Code:
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
        int doswap=0;
        for(int i=n-1;i>=1;i--){
            
            for(int j=0;j<=i-1;j++){
                if(arr[j]>arr[j+1]){
                    int temp=arr[j];
                    arr[j]=arr[j+1];
                    arr[j+1]=temp;
                    doswap=1;
                }
            }
            if(doswap==0)break;
        }
}

Time Complexity : O(n^2)
