Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum (or maximum, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning.

My Approach: 
Selection of Minimum Element: Find the smallest element in the array and swap it with the element at the first position.
Subsequent Subarrays: Move the boundary of the unsorted subarray one element to the right.
Repeat: Continue the above steps until the entire array is sorted.

Implementation : 

  void selectionSort(int arr[], int n)
    {
       for(int i=0;i<=n-2;i++){
           int min=i;
           for(int j=i;j<=n-1;j++){
               if(arr[j]<arr[min]){
                   min=j;
                   
               }
           }
               int temp=arr[i];
               arr[i]=arr[min];
               arr[min]=temp;
           
       }
    }

Time Complexity : O(n^2)
