The "aggressive cows" problem is a classic problem that involves placing cows in stalls such that the minimum distance between any two cows is maximized. Here's how you can solve this problem using binary search:

Problem Statement:
Given an array of positions positions representing the positions of stalls and an integer C representing the number of cows, find the maximum possible minimum distance between cows when placing them optimally in the stalls.

Approach:
Binary Search Setup:

Left Bound (left): Initialize it to 1, which is the minimum possible distance between cows.
Right Bound (right): Initialize it to the difference between the maximum and minimum positions in positions, which is the maximum possible distance between cows.
Binary Search Execution:

While left is less than or equal to right:
Calculate the middle value mid (mid = (left + right) / 2), which represents the current guess for the maximum minimum distance.
Check if it's possible to place all cows such that the minimum distance between any two cows is at least mid.
If true, then mid might be a valid distance, so try to find a larger distance (left = mid + 1).
Otherwise, reduce the distance (right = mid - 1).
Feasibility Check Function canPlaceCows:

Place the first cow in the first stall (positions[0]).
Iterate through the remaining stalls and place cows whenever the distance to the last placed cow is at least mid.
Count how many cows can be placed and check if it meets or exceeds C.
Termination:

The binary search terminates when left exceeds right. At this point, right will be the maximum possible minimum distance that allows placing all cows optimally.

Code:
int check(vector<int>a,int m,int mid){
    int last=a[0];
    int c=1;
    for(int i=1;i<a.size();i++){
        if(a[i]-last>=mid){
            c++;
            last=a[i];
        }
    }
    if(c>=m)return 1;
    else return 0;
}
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& position, int m) {
        int n=position.size();
        sort(position.begin(),position.end());
        int l=1;int h=position[n-1]-position[0]+1;
        while(l<=h){
            int mid=(l+h)/2;
            int c=check(position,m,mid);
            if(c==0){
                h=mid-1;
            }
            else{
                
                l=mid+1;
            }
        }
        return h;
        
    }
