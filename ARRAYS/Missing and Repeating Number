The function findTwoElement appears to be designed to find two elements in an array a of size N that are missing from a sequence of integers from 1 to N. 
Approach :
This function assumes that the input array a contains exactly two missing numbers from the sequence [1, 2, ..., N].
It uses mathematical formulas derived from the properties of arithmetic and sums of squares to determine the missing numbers efficiently.
Ensure that the input array a is properly prepared and that N matches the size of a to get correct results.
The function returns a vector containing the two missing numbers.

Code:

vector<int> findTwoElement(vector<int>a, int N) {
    long long n=N;
    long long SN = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
    long long S2N = (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6;

    // Calculate S and S2:
    long long S = 0, S2 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        S += a[i];
        S2 += (long long)a[i] * (long long)a[i];
    }

    //S-Sn = X-Y:
    long long val1 = S - SN;

    // S2-S2n = X^2-Y^2:
    long long val2 = S2 - S2N;

    //Find X+Y = (X^2-Y^2)/(X-Y):
    val2 = val2 / val1;

    //Find X and Y: X = ((X+Y)+(X-Y))/2 and Y = X-(X-Y),
    // Here, X-Y = val1 and X+Y = val2:
    long long x = (val1 + val2) / 2;
    long long y = x - val1;

    return {(int)x, (int)y};
}

Time complexity : O(N)
